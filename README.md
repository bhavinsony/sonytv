Hi there ,
I love to learn new things all the times. not just coding but in everything. even though i dont try if its risky but i love knowing why about it.
From eletrical to food, from building something for kids school or to find reason why bread works even if eaten everyday.

my primary intrest is coding. been freelaner since 15 years or more. made hundred of projects for client but due to busy schedule never used github before. but now i know what its important and now building project on it.
